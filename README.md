# tmpshare

Easily share temporary files over http

Like https://transfer.sh/ but with following differences:

- Shared files are deleted immediately once they are downloaded
- Files are encrypted on the server and no encryption key is saved on the server

## Installation

    npm install tmpshare

## Usage

Uploads can be done using the buildin form or curl:

    $ curl -T file.txt example.com
    http://example.com/download/2015-03-29-14-57-a25bd309c8/file.txt#6028503d10954b73ab57e326997bca0b67c5b061

    $ curl -F file=@file.txt -F file2=@file2.txt example.com
    http://example.com/download/2015-03-29-14-58-bd7dd3cfb3/file.txt#4806f599e6d104b2ab93c709db2c3769d576eb8d
    http://example.com/download/2015-03-29-14-58-e600a5b4fa/file2.txt#87fa049560d6b3f4b9fa77d1708dc6b399eb3d4c


## Standalone server

    tmpshare --port 1234 ./uploads

## Express middleware

```js
var app = express();

app.use("/tmp", require("tmpshare")({
    dir: __dirname + "/uploads"
}));
```

## How?

When upload begins an encryption key is generated on the server and the file
stream is piped through an encryption transform to the disk. The plain file is
never touches the disk (unless you use nginx ([ticket][]) or some other proxy which
buffers uploads to disk).

[ticket]: http://trac.nginx.org/nginx/ticket/251

After the upload a download URL is generated and the encryption key is put in
the fragment identifier. It's put there in order to avoid it appearing server
request logs when the URL is opened in the browser as fragments are never sent
to the server. User is redirected to the URL and the encryption key is
discarded.

User is presented with a download form generated by client-side Javascript.
When the form is posted the encryption key is sent to the server in the request
body and the file download begins. After the download finishes the file is
deleted from the server.
